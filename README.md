## What problem it solves
Many beginners and early-career developers struggle with not knowing what to learn as there are many programming languages to choose, in what order, and how to practice effectively. Mapito solves this by generating an AI-generated learning roadmap based on the user’s goals — such as becoming a frontend developer or learning a specific language like Python — and combining it with practical tools like quizzes, a live code compiler, and AI-based mock interviews.

## Who it’s for
Mapito is built for:

Students and self-taught developers looking for clear guidance.

Beginner developers who want to strengthen their skills.

Anyone preparing for technical interviews or switching into tech careers.

## What makes it unique or different
Mapito stands out by integrating AI-generated roadmaps with a complete set of interactive tools, all in one place:

An in-browser code compiler for hands-on practice.

Adaptive quizzes that respond to progress.

AI-powered features like note summarization and realistic mock interviews.

Extra tools like typing tests and documentation resources.

Unlike other platforms that focus only on video lessons or static content, Mapito provides a dynamic and supportive environment that grows with the learner, prioritizes ethical AI use, and protects user privacy.
